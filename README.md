Assignment submissions for the Deep Learning Specialization provided by deeplearning.ai on Coursera - enrolled on May 1, 2019 and ended on July 6, 2019. The specialization contains 5 courses:
- [Course 1] Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- [Course 2] Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
- [Course 3] Structuring Machine Learning Projects (no Jupyter Notebook submissions)
- [Course 4] Convolutional Neural Networks
- [Course 5] Sequence Models

Learned a lot of deep learning concepts such as neural networks and trying to train them, CNNs, LSTMs, and RNNs, as well as the mathematical fundamentals of what makes them work, including backpropagation, activation functions, et cetera.

Learned linear algebra and machine learning libraries such as numpy, TensorFlow and Keras.

Coded in Python 3.6.
